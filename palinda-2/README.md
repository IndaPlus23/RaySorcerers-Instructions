### Deadline:
This work should be completed before the exercise on **Friday 22nd of March**.

### Instructions
For instructions on how to do and submit the assignment, please see
the
[assignments section of the course instructions](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-23/course-instructions#assignments).

### Homework
Study the following course literature:

- Read the following from the [Fundamentals of Concurrent Programming](http://yourbasic.org/golang/concurrent-programming/)
  - [Channels](http://yourbasic.org/golang/channels-explained/)
  - [Select](http://yourbasic.org/golang/select-explained/)
  - [Data races](http://yourbasic.org/golang/data-races-explained/)
  - [Detecting data races](http://yourbasic.org/golang/detect-data-races/)
  - [Deadlock](http://yourbasic.org/golang/detect-deadlock/)

### Task 1 - Debugging Concurrent Programs
In this task, you will be provided with two buggy programs. For each program,
you should:

1. Explain what is wrong with the code.
2. Fix the bug.
3. Explain why your solution fixes the bug.

#### Buggy program 1
[src/bug01.go](src/bug01.go)

#### Buggy program 2
[src/bug02.go](src/bug02.go)

> **Assistant's requirement:** You are not allowed to move or remove the
> time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond) statement in the Print function. A
> deterministic solution (e.g. using a channel or WaitGroup) is required and
> removing the sleep is only a quick fix.

### Task 2 - Many Senders; Many Receivers
The program [many2many.go](src/many2many.go) contains four
producers that together send 32 strings over a channel. At the
other end there are two consumers that receive the strings.
Describe what happens, and explain why it happens, if you make the
following changes in the program. Try first to reason your way
through, and then test your hypothesis by changing and running the
program.

* What happens if you switch the order of the statements
  `wgp.Wait()` and `close(ch)` in the end of the `main` function?
* What happens if you move the `close(ch)` from the `main` function
  and instead close the channel in the end of the function
  `Produce`?
* What happens if you remove the statement `close(ch)` completely?
* What happens if you increase the number of consumers from 2 to 4?
* Can you be sure that all strings are printed before the program
  stops?

Finally, modify the code by adding a new WaitGroup that waits for
all consumers to finish.

### Task 3 - Pythia, the Oracle of Delphi

The code in [oracle.go](src/oracle.go) contains the outline for a program that
will answer 'questions' (like a chatbot, but worse).  Complete the `Oracle`
function.  You should not modify the `main` function or other function
signatures. Note that answers should not appear immediately; instead there
should be a random delay or **pause for thought**.  Also, the Oracle will still
print **helpful predictions** even if there are not any questions, after a
random amount of time. You may structure your solution into multiple functions.

Your program should contain two channels: One channel for questions,
and one for answers and predictions.  In the `Oracle` function you
should start three infinite go-routines.

* A go-routine that receives all questions, and for each incoming
  question, creates a separate go-routine that answers that question
* A go-routine that generates predictions
* A go-routine that receives all answers and predictions, and prints
  then to stdout

Whilst the `Oracle` function is the most important of the
assignment, you should also make the following improvements:

* Parse input for specific keywords ("What is the meaning of life?") and create a response ("Ah, life! ...")
* Prints answers and predictions one character at a time with a short delay
* Your own creative chat-bot-like idea :-)
