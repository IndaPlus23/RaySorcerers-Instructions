# Quicksort

This is the last assignment of DD1338!

It is obligatory for all students of the course, regardless of being a plus group or not, to have implemented the quicksort algorithm.

Your assignment this week is therefore of course to implement the quicksort algorithm. On top of implementing the fundamental algorithm you also need to optimize it by using insertion sort for smaller arrays and picking a pivot element cleverly, or any other technique. Try to get on the leaderboard!

To pass the assignment you need to have passed the Kattis assignment. (link below)

Info about quicksort and some well-known optimizations can be read about on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort).

## Instructions

1. Create a repository named `<KTH-ID>-quicksort`.
2. Clone your newly created repository and start coding.
3. Submit your solution to [Kattis](https://kth.kattis.com/courses/DD1338/algdat23). (the assignment might not yet exist on Kattis)
4. Upload a screenshot of passing the Kattis tests to your repo here.
